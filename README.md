This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Face Recognition app

In construction... 

### `Objective`

Create a responsive webpage that users can: 

- Sign In 
- Input an image 
- Check if the input image has a face, which will have a box over it
- Sign Out

### `Where we are at`

So far: the API is working, we do get a response from API and are able to console.log response. Button and Input work. Website gives bounding box over the image, on top of the face. API works.

All buttons and links are working properly, directing the user to Sign In, Register, and Home.

### `Next steps`

We need to create our Server.

To be defined later.
