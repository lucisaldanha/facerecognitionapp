This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Face Recognition app

In construction... 

### `Objective`

Create a responsive webpage that users can: 

- Sign In 
- Input an image 
- Check if the input image has a face, which will have a box over it
- Sign Out

### `State we are at`

So far: the API is working, able to recognize faces over an image in our website. 
However, our website gives a bounding box over the image, on top of one face. 

All buttons and links are working properly, directing the user to Sign In, Register, and Home.

### `Next steps`

We need to work on being able to have multiple bounding boxes over the image faces.

We need to create our Server.

To be defined later.
