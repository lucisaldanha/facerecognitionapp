This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Face Recognition app

In construction... 

### `Objective`

Create a responsive webpage that you are able to: 

- sign in 
- input an image in a form
- check if the input form image has a face
- sign out

### `Where we are at`

So far: the API is working, we do get a response from API and are able to console.log response. Button and Input work. Website gives bounding box over the image, on top of the face. API works.

### `Next steps`

To be defined later.
