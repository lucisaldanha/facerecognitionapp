This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Face Recognition app

In construction... 

### `Objective`

Create a responsive webpage that users can: 

- Sign In 
- Input an image 
- Check if the input image has a face, which will have a box over it
- Sign Out

### `State we are at`

So far: the API is working, able to recognize faces over an image in our website. 
However, our website gives a bounding box over the image, on top of one face. 

All buttons and links are working properly, directing the user to Sign In, Register, and Home.

### `Past steps`

- Connect to Database and Server.


### `Next steps`

- Check if Server and Database work properly with Front End, with new'users' are able to Register and Log In. Also, Front-End should work in cases of existing email registering. 90%

- Set website to be online.

- Website could recognize more than one face in an image.

To be defined later.
